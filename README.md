# mds_app
App to assist with filling a mds template

# Current issues
• Memory leaks: Need to properly unbind and delete tabs and its widgets
• App is too bit in some screens: Need to change structure to allow scrollbar for the tab (use canvas)
• Tabs are getting renamed to the name of deleted tabs: Need to change tabs to be classes to fix issues with 


# possible next aditions 
add deep-translator - might not be good enough 
the translator should affect the whole mds and worknotes

there needs to be a button to copy only the worknotes

? preview window at the end of the form 

add a wallpaper and darkmode
